---
- 🧠 [ODE control with Deep Q Learning](https://github.com/fraromeo/ODE_control_with_deepQlearning)
  
  Goal: avoid extinction of a population of prey and predators by controlling the values of ODE's parameters in a reinforcement learning setting. 

- 🚗 [Multi Object Tracking in Complex Urban Scenarios](https://github.com/fraromeo/Multi-Object-Tracking-in-Complex-Urban-Scenarios) : a project in collaboration with `Viscando AB`. 
  
  Goal: develop an algorithm to perform online tracking of vehicles and pedestrians in a roundabout. The main tool used is Kalman Filters. 
- ⚕️ [Heterogeneity assessment for Chemoterapy-Injured Liver in Patients with Colorectal Cancer](https://github.com/fraromeo/Chemotherapy-Associated-Liver-Injury)
  
  Goal: Given 3D virtual biopses of livers of patients that underwent chemotherapy, understand the relationship between heterogeneities of the volumes and presence of CALI, also exploiting clinical covariates.
 
- 🚑 [Prediction of covid-related variables](https://github.com/fraromeo/covid_prediction)
  
  Goal: produce a model that is able to predict in an accurate way the values of daily new infections and recovered, as well as increment in deceased and hospitalised patients using ARIMA model and artificial neural network. 
  
- 🏠 [House Pricing Prediction](https://github.com/fraromeo/Real_Estate)
  
   Goal: Predict house pricing in a given Italian city.
